abstract: |
  One century after its formulation, Einstein's general relativity
  (GR) has made remarkable predictions and turned out to be compatible
  with all experimental tests. Most of these tests probe the theory in
  the weak-field regime, and there are theoretical and experimental
  reasons to believe that GR should be modified when gravitational
  fields are strong and spacetime curvature is large. The best
  astrophysical laboratories to probe strong-field gravity are black
  holes and neutron stars, whether isolated or in binary systems. We
  review the motivations to consider extensions of GR. We present a
  (necessarily incomplete) catalog of modified theories of gravity for
  which strong-field predictions have been computed and contrasted to
  Einstein's theory, and we summarize our current understanding of the
  structure and dynamics of compact objects in these theories. We
  discuss current bounds on modified gravity from binary pulsar and
  cosmological observations, and we highlight the potential of future
  gravitational wave measurements to inform us on the behavior of
  gravity in the strong-field regime.
