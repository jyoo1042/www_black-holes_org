  The closed-form solution of the 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) accurate
  binary black hole (BBH) Hamiltonian system has proven to be evasive
  for a long time since the introduction of the system in 1966.
  Solutions of the PN BBH systems with arbitrary parameters (masses,
  spins, eccentricity) are required for modeling the gravitational
  waves emitted by them. Accurate models of gravitational waves are
  crucial for their detection by LIGO/Virgo and LISA. Only recently,
  two solution methods for solving the BBH dynamics were proposed in
  Ref. [G. Cho and H. M. Lee, Phys. Rev. D 100, 044046 (2019)]
  (without using action-angle variables), and Refs. [S. Tanay , Phys.
  Rev. D 103, 064066 (2021), S. Tanay , Phys. Rev. D 107, 103040
  (2023)] (action-angle based). This paper combines the ideas laid out
  in the above articles, fills the missing gaps and compiles the two
  solutions which are fully 1.5PN accurate. We also present a public
  Mathematica package bbhpntoolkit which implements these two
  solutions and compares them with the result of numerical integration
  of the evolution equations. The level of agreement between these
  solutions provides a numerical verification for all the five action
  variables constructed in Refs. [S. Tanay , Phys. Rev. D 103, 064066
  (2021), S. Tanay , Phys. Rev. D 107, 103040 (2023)]. This paper
  hence serves as a stepping stone for pushing the action-angle-based
  solution to 2PN order via canonical perturbation theory.
