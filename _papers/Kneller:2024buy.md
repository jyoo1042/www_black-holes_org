  A computationally efficient method for calculating the transport of
  neutrino flavor in simulations is to use angular moments of the
  neutrino one-body reduced density matrix, i.e., `quantum moments'.
  As with any moment-based radiation transport method, a closure is
  needed if the infinite tower of moment evolution equations is
  truncated. We derive a general parameterization of a quantum closure
  and the limits the parameters must satisfy in order for the closure
  to be physical. We then derive from multi-angle calculations the
  evolution of the closure parameters in two test cases which we then
  progressively insert into a moment evolution code and show how the
  parameters affect the moment results until the full multi-angle
  results are reproduced. This parameterization paves the way to
  setting prescriptions for genuine quantum closures adapted to
  neutrino transport in a range of situations.
