  We discuss a number of long-standing theoretical questions about
  collapse to black holes in the Brans-Dicke theory of gravitation.
  Using a new numerical code, we show that Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse
  in this theory produces black holes that are identical to those of
  general relativity in final equilibrium, but are quite different
  from those of general relativity during dynamical evolution. We find
  that there are epochs during which the apparent horizon of such a
  black hole passes {\it outside\/} the event horizon, and that the
  surface area of the event horizon {\it decreases\/} with time. This
  behavior is possible because theorems which prove otherwise assume
  $R_{ab}l~al~b \ge 0$ for all null vectors $l~a$. We show that
  dynamical spacetimes in Brans-Dicke theory can violate this
  inequality, even in vacuum, for any value of $\omega$.
