  We study isolated and binary neutron stars in dynamical Chern-Simons
  gravity. This theory modifies the Einstein-Hilbert action through
  the introduction of a dynamical scalar field coupled to the
  Pontryagin density. We here treat this theory as an effective model,
  working to leading order in the Chern-Simons coupling. We first
  construct isolated neutron star solutions in the slow-rotation
  expansion to quadratic order in spin. We find that isolated neutron
  stars acquire a scalar dipole charge that corrects its spin angular
  momentum to linear order in spin and corrects its mass and
  quadrupole moment to quadratic order in spin, as measured by an
  observer at spatial infinity. We then consider neutron stars
  binaries that are widely separated and solve for their orbital
  evolution in this modified theory. We find that the evolution of
  post-Keplerian parameters is modified, with the rate of periastron
  advance being the dominant correction at first post-Newtonian order.
  We conclude by applying these results to observed pulsars with the
  aim to place constraints on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We find
  that the modifications to the observed mass are degenerate with the
  neutron star equation of state, which prevents us from testing the
  theory with the inferred mass of the millisecond pulsar J1614-2230.
  We also find that the corrections to the post-Keplerian parameters
  are too small to be observable today even with data from the double
  binary pulsar J0737-3039. Our results suggest that pulsar
  observations are not currently capable of constraining dynamical
  Chern-Simons gravity, and thus, gravitational-wave observations may
  be the only path to a stringent constraint of this theory in the
  imminent future.
