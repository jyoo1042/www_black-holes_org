  Astrophysical observations of the cosmos allow us to probe extreme
  physics and answer foundational questions on our universe. Modern
  astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach,
  probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how
  sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic
  spectrum, and through their other signatures, including
  gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth.
  Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where
  approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest
  are explosive transients, whose understanding requires
  multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics,
  gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and
  turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and
  optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation
  transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper
  provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at
  the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed
  through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration
  of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory
  descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key
  astrophysical sources of interest.
