  General relativity has passed all solar system experiments and
  neutron star based tests, such as binary pulsar observations, with
  flying colors. A more exotic arena for testing general relativity is
  in systems that contain one or more black holes. Black holes are the
  most compact objects in the Universe, providing probes of the
  strongest-possible gravitational fields. We are motivated to study
  strong-field gravity since many theories give large deviations from
  general relativity only at large field strengths, while recovering
  the weak-field behavior. In this article, we review how one can
  probe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity
  by using electromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion
  disk, and gravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first
  review model-independent ways of testing gravity with
  electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black hole system. We
  then focus on selected examples of theories that extend general
  relativity in rather simple ways. Some important characteristics of
  general relativity include (but are not limited to) (i) only tensor
  gravitational degrees of freedom, (ii) the graviton is massless,
  (iii) no quadratic or higher curvatures in the action, and (iv) the
  theory is four-dimensional. Altering a characteristic leads to a
  different extension of general relativity: (i) scalar–tensor
  theories, (ii) massive gravity theories, (iii) quadratic gravity,
  and (iv) theories with large extra dimensions. Within each theory,
  we describe black hole solutions, their properties, and current and
  projected constraints on each theory using black hole based tests of
  gravity. We close this review by listing some of the open problems
  in model-independent tests and within each specific theory.
